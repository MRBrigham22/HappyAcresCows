      <p class="w3-large">Dairy cows may be found either in herds or dairy farms where dairy farmers own, manage, care for, and collect milk from them, or on commercial farms. Herd sizes vary around the world depending on landholding culture and social structure. The United States has an estimated 9 million cows in around 75,000 dairy herds, with an average herd size of 120 cows. The number of small herds is falling rapidly with the 3,100 herds with over 500 cows producing 51% of U.S. milk in 2007.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">The United States dairy herd produced 84.2 billion kilograms (185.7 billion pounds) of milk in 2007, up from 52.9 billion kilograms (116.6 billion pounds) in 1950, yet there were only about 9 million cows on U.S. dairy farms—about 13 million fewer than there were in 1950.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Types of Dairy Cows</h1><br>
      <h4 style="color:rgb(235, 172, 164)"> Jersey Cattle</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">The Jersey is a British breed of small dairy cattle from Jersey, in the British Channel Islands. It is highly productive – cows may give over 10 times their own weight in milk per lactation; the milk is high in butterfat and has a characteristic yellowish tinge.</p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:rgb(235, 172, 164)">Holstein Friesian Cattle</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">The Holsteins are a breed of dairy cattle that originated in the Dutch provinces of North Holland and Friesland, and Schleswig-Holstein in Northern Germany. They are known as the world's highest-producing dairy animals.</p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:rgb(235, 172, 164)">Guernsey Cattle</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">The Guernsey is a breed of dairy cattle from the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is fawn or red and white in colour, and is hardy and docile. Its milk is rich in flavour, high in fat and protein, and has a golden-yellow tinge due to its high β-carotene content.</p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:rgb(235, 172, 164)">Ayrshire Cattle</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">The Ayrshire is a Scottish breed of dairy cattle. It originates in, and is named for, the county of Ayrshire in south-western Scotland. Ayrshires typically have red and white markings; the red can range from a shade of orange to a dark brown. They are hardy and efficiently convert grass into milk.</p><br>
    
      <h4 style="color:rgb(235, 172, 164)">Brown Swiss cattle</h4>
      <p class="w3-large">The Brown Swiss is an American breed of dairy cattle. It derives from the traditional triple-purpose Braunvieh ("Swiss Brown") of the Alpine region of Europe, but has diverged substantially from it. It was selectively bred for dairy qualities only, and its draft and beef capabilities were lost.</p>

  <!-- Be Kind to Cows! -->
  <div class="w3-row w3-padding-64" Id="kind">
  
      <h1 class="w3-center">Be Kind to Cows!</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-center">Cows bond closely with their herd and create close friendships. They can anticipate the future and experience pain, fear and anxiety, which makes the abuses of factory farms all the more cruel. The dairy industry likes to show images of cows grazing on rolling green pastures, but most of the roughly nine million cows used for dairy in the United States are confined either indoors or in dirt feedlots without a blade of grass. And calves used for veal are taken from their mothers shortly after birth before being forced to spend their short lives in tiny crates.</p>
      <p class="w3-center"> The U.S. dairy industry subjects cows to cruel treatment that includes repeated impregnation, forced overproduction of milk, restrictive confinement and poor nutrition. Cows’ welfare could be vastly improved by providing more available space, opportunities for exercise and access to pasture to help avoid the health, stress and behavioral problems associated with poor conditions.
        <h1 class="w3-center">Did You Know?</h1><br>
        <p class="w3-center"> Cows display their emotions in subtle ways. A low ear position and cool nose, for example, mean that a cow is feeling good.
